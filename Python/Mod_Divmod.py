"""
One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments a and b and 
returns a tuple containing the quotient of a/b first and then the remainder a%b.

Read in two integers, a and b, and print three lines.
The first line is the integer division a//b.
The second line is the result of the modulo operator: a%b.
The third line prints the divmod of a and b.

a = int(input())
b = int(input())

print(a//b)
print(a%b)
print(divmod(a,b))
